# Akram Mansour - Personal Portfolio

I've deployed my portfolio on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at [https://akman13.github.io/portfolio/](https://akman13.github.io/portfolio/).

## Stacks & Features
This is a static portfolio that has been created to introduce myself to any interested viewers as well as an excuse to get familiar with some new techs!

This site was built using:
1. ReactJs 
2. Tailwind for CSS utility
3. Mantine for the carousel display
4. ButterCMS for content management, and
5. Formspree for handling form submissions
